# Curated Regional Earthquake Waveforms (CREW) Dataset

The paper is coming soon, keep an eye out on Seismica

CREW is quality controlled dataset of earthquake waveforms and earthquake wave arrival times that is global in coverage and focused in the regional distances. Hundreds of thousands of earthquakes from all longitudes, latitudes and depths recorded at thousands of seismic stations around the world.

## In a Nutshell
1.6 Million examples with both P and S arrival times recorded on three components for five minutes. This is what you will find:

We are finalizing the permanent storage place for the dataset, stay tuned. You can see a demo of the data here:

# Interoperability
We are working to get the dataset formatted to be compatible with Seisbench

Check CREW_convert_to_Seisbench.ipynb for conversion details. There is a very small sample of the data in Seisbench format in the folder seisbench_conversion.

This is temporary while we figure out the best way to make the dataset useful and easy to use.
