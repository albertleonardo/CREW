# Curated Regional Earhtquake Waveforms (CREW) Dataset

The paper is coming soon, keep an eye out on Seismica

CREW is quality controlled dataset of earthquake waveforms and earthquake wave arrival times that is global in coverage and focused in the regional distances. Hundreds of thousands of earthquakes from all longitudes, latitudes and depths recorded at thousands of seismic stations around the world.
